# Build Dashboard in this project

First you need to make sure you have the file [DashBoard](DS_AS\DS_AS-1734950382240.json) that I include in my zip.
Next open Grafana in localhost, then go to DashBoard window ![alt text](image-1.png) 
Then click on New in the left-corner
then choose Import ![alt text](image-2.png)
You will see window like this
